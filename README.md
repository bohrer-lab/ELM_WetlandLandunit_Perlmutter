ELM-Wet
================================================================================
ELM-Wet is a modified version of the E3SM Land Model (ELM) that improves representation of wetlands.
ELM-Wet implements a wetland land unit with sub-grid representation of eco-hydrological patches
and hydrological forcing.

ELM-Wet was forked from E3SM. For more information about E3SM, please see the
[E3SM repository](https://github.com/E3SM-Project/E3SM/) and [project website](https://e3sm.org).
